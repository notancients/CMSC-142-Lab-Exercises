Running time:
In graphColoring() we can be sure that the code will run |v| times since we
have to color all vertices.

Finding the available color consists of two parts,
checking the adjacency and checking availability of
colors. Both have a maximum time of |v| assuming that
all vertices are connected to each other and therefore
needing a different color for each one for a total
of |v|.
